I made some significant changes to my project since Part II. I started this project with the idea that I would repurpose an existing data document and visualize it in a unique way to call attention to the business opportunities in Larimer. But as the project progressed, I realized that there was more to Larimer's story than the high-level demographic numbers and information related to market conditions. At the same time, as I talked to people about my project, I was surprised by how little they knew about Larimer and its transformation. 

As someone who enjoys cities and is interested in urban issues, I thought Larimer, the community, deserved its own story. I felt more people should learn about Larimer because its journey is in many ways emblematic of what's happening in Pittsburgh. My goal was to inspire people to learn about Larimer and visit the once overlooked neighborhood. A second goal was to signal to potential business owners that the URA is a willing partner eager to help new businesses in Larimer.
