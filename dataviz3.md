I chose a visualization that depicts the probabilities of the teams that still have a shot at making the MLB playoffs for the National League. I chose this chart because it's very topical as the baseball regular season is winding down, and five teams are vying for the remaining two post-season spots. As a baseball fan, I am constantly wondering what my team's odds are of making the playoffs, and had come across the chart above. Fangraphs is a respected source, and I thought I could make some improvements for my benefit and other fans.
