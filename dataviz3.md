I chose a visualization that depicts the probabilities of the teams that still have a shot at making the MLB playoffs for the National League. I chose this chart because it's very topical as the baseball regular season is winding down, and five teams are vying for the remaining two post-season spots. As a baseball fan, I am constantly wondering what my team's odds are of making the playoffs, and had come across the chart above. Fangraphs is a respected source, and I thought I could make some improvements for my benefit and other fans. 
#### Things that don't work with the original graph

The lines portray interesting information, but they're hard to track. People are interested in where the teams are right now. They also introduce too much color.  Instead of showing the probabilities of the teams over time, I decided to focus on the endpoints to show each team's chances right now.  

#### Wireframing

I came up with two different mock-ups that I showed to two people. Both told me that the dot plot with a single axis was easier to understand. I also was told that it was not obvious how many teams could make it to the playoffs, so I adjusted the title to make that clearer. Another piece of feedback I recieved was that the color codes were confusing. I had made the teams that would make the playoffs if the season ended today green and those that would be out red. My critics felt the colors made it unclear that the playoff race was still fluid and could change. I removed the colors.
