# Final Project Part II
For my wireframe/storyboard, I decided to start a working draft using ESRI StoryMaps. 

The story I want to tell is straightforward. Business owners should consider Larimer, a low-income and historically underserved community, as a place to start their business. The city and the URA have made serious investments in the community, and prospective business owners would be wise to leverage those investments. 

For my user research, I asked the people I spoke with three simple questions. Those questions and the feedback I recieved are below. 

### What was the story I was telling?
It was clear that people understood I was trying to tell a story about selling Larimer as a potential location for new businesses. However, two people emphasized Larimer as low-income. It was clear that the word "low-income" really stuck out. I included the median household income choropleth map because it helped add conflict to my story and make it more compelling. Also, during our in-class critique, my peer reviewer made a good point that people looking to Larimer for their business location might become concerned about the viability of their business if they saw a slide about how it is a low-income neighborhood. One way to get around this would be to introduce some narrative in the story that explains that the type of business owner who would be successful in Larimer is community-centered and mindful of the challenges but wants to contribute to the community.

### Did the visualizations help the story?
Everyone I spoke to said the visualizations helped. 

### What could I have done differently to enhance the story?
I heard that I could better build a case about why Larimer was an excellent option for business owners. Hearing that feedback, I plan to highlight some more statistics and add some narrative to highlight the magnitude of recent public investments in Larimer. I can also highlight some programs the URA offers to help people that want to start a business in Larimer. 

Someone told me that the retail gap bar char was "hard to understand and that it was unclear why some bars were labeled, and others were not." I agree. I need to find a way to clean up the chart. One of the things I could do is make the labels shorter. 

People I interviewed liked the tour map feature at the end, but a couple of people told me that the pictures could be better and that I should highlight more businesses since my presentation is about companies. I plan on going to Larimer and taking my own pictures on my phone to include in the story map. 

Overall the feedback I recieved was constructive. I plan to meet with people from the URA this week and incorporate their comments into my final presentation.
