# About me
My name is Oscar Medina. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying management and public policy.  I am originally from San Diego, California, and my background is in transportation planning. 

I started my career working at a private planning consulting firm that specialized in online community engagement. After a year, I moved to a mobility-focused nonprofit that advocates for smart growth initiatives and pedestrian/bike safety projects. Right before moving to Pittsburgh, I worked at an environmental justice organization on transportation policy issues. 

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn about what makes something appealing and attractive. I want to produce products that catch people's attention and get noticed. I also want to learn mistakes I should avoid. I want to know what I am doing wrong so that I can make adjustments and do better. I also want to learn about new tools and resources that could help me produce beautiful graphs.
