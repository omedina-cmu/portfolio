# Final Project Part I

#### Summary 

For my summer internship, I worked at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the economic development arm of the City of Pittsburgh. One of the things they had me do was update their neighborhood business district profiles. Primary, the task involved pulling data from Esri Business Analyst and collating information into a pdf template. The profiles are distributed at community meetings and also live on the URA website. Except for 2020, the URA updates these profiles every year. 

There are over 50 unique main-street business districts in Pittsburgh. The URA releases the business district profiles to inform the public and prospective business owners about market conditions in each neighborhood. They are fact sheets meant to give people a snapshot view of the business landscape. 

The profiles are presented matter-of-factly. But, they are the perfect source material for a story I want to tell: there are opportunities for folks to start businesses in historically underserved communities. 

For my story, I will focus on Larimer.

#### Sketches
The profiles tell us the ratio of employees to businesses in each community. I could create a scatter plot to show where Larimer ranks among the other districts.

I like this type of graph to show how Larimer is underserved versus a comparison community. I will probably choose East Liberty or Shadyside because they are adjacent to Larimer. I would pull the comparison data from their profiles.

A tree map chart could effectively show the composition of the types of businesses currently in Larimer.

A column in the table on the first page has the retail gap (demand minus supply) of different sectors. I want to create a bar graph sorted in descending order to show opportunities for unmet demand.

#### Data Source

I am using the [2019 Larimer business district profile](https://www.ura.org/business-district-profiles/larimer-larimer-avenue) as my source data because the updates I worked on during the summer are still working their way through the review process and are not yet final. Also, the 2019 profiles are publicly accessible on the [URA website](https://www.ura.org/business-district-profiles). For any comparisons, I will use data from those respective business districts. 

#### Method

I plan to use Esri Story Maps. The place-based nature of my project will work in this format. Story maps will allow me to embed my charts into it and also let me incorporate spatial data. The URA has a shapefile for all the districts, and I could quickly join the data I have with those files. 

However, the main reason I want to use story maps is for the tour feature, where I could show prospective business owners that the URA is invested in Larimer by showcasing a few projects they've completed in the project. These investments demonstrate that the URA has skin in the game and will work closely with businesses to succeed.
