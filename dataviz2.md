### Part 2: Working with Flourish
The below graphs show GDP debt ratios for 35 countries ordered alphabetically.

This visualization displays the same information as above but as individual graphs that you can toggle between by using the dropdown menu on the upper left.

#### USA's High GDP Debt Ratio (2020)

Among the countries that reported data in 2020, the United States had the second-largest GDP debt ratio. It was topped only by Greece.

The Grid of Line charts were helpful to look at a lot of charts at once. Someone could quickly evaluate all the countries and do some quick analysis. However, because there were so many charts, it was a little overwhelming. I decided to make a visualization that allowed you to toggle between the different countries. This way, a person could dig deeper and without as much clutter. The chart would help people that often reference the data from multiple counties find the information they need in an organized way. 

Finally, for the third visualization, I decided to do away with the time series line chart and instead give the reader a snapshot of the latest numbers, focusing on where the United States stacked up against other countries. To make the chart, I went to the data viewer and sorted the data by year and deleted everything, not in 2020. I then did another sort to display the data in ascending order from smallest debt ratio to largest. I  highlighted the US and made the rest of the colors light grey.
